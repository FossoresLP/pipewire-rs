//! This module provides a channel for communicating with a thread running a pipewire loop.
//! The channel is split into two types, [`Sender`] and [`Receiver`].
//!
//! It can be created using the [`channel`] function.
//! The returned receiver can then be attached to a pipewire loop, and the sender can be used to send messages to
//! the receiver.
//!
//! # Examples
//! This program will print "Hello" three times before terminating, using two threads:
// ignored because https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/pipewire/pipewire-rs/-/issues/19
//! ```no_run
//! use std::{time::Duration, sync::mpsc, thread};
//! use pipewire::{MainLoop, Loop};
//!
//! // Our message to the pipewire loop, this tells it to terminate.
//! struct Terminate;
//!
//! fn main() {
//!     let (main_sender, main_receiver) = mpsc::channel();
//!     let (pw_sender, pw_receiver) = pipewire::channel::channel();
//!
//!     let pw_thread = thread::spawn(move || pw_thread(main_sender, pw_receiver));
//!
//!     // Count up to three "Hello"'s.
//!     let mut n = 0;
//!     while n < 3 {
//!         println!("{}", main_receiver.recv().unwrap());
//!         n += 1;
//!     }
//!
//!     // We printed hello 3 times, terminate the pipewire thread now.
//!     pw_sender.send(Terminate);
//!
//!     pw_thread.join();
//! }
//!
//! // This is the code that will run in the pipewire thread.
//! fn pw_thread(
//!     main_sender: mpsc::Sender<String>,
//!     pw_receiver: pipewire::channel::Receiver<Terminate>
//! ) {
//!     let mainloop = MainLoop::new().expect("Failed to create main loop");
//!
//!     // When we receive a `Terminate` message, quit the main loop.
